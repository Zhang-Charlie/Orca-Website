# 🐋 Orca Website

A simple multi page website about orcas that I built **to learn HTML**, practice basic **CSS**, and experiment with very light **JavaScript**.  
The project helped me understand how real websites are structured, how pages link together, and how to organise files properly.

## 🌊 Purpose of the Project

I made this website as a beginner project to:

- Understand how **multiple pages** connect using relative links
- Practice **CSS styling**, layout, colours, and responsive adjustments
- Organise files into folders (`css`, `img`, `js`) like real web projects
- Try a small amount of **JavaScript** for simple interactions
- Practice deploying a website on **Vercel**
